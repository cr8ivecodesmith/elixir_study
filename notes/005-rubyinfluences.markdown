Ruby Influences
===============

The author of the language was a Ruby core developer so a lot of syntax has
been carried over.

```iex
iex(7)> name="matt"
"matt"
iex(8)> "Hello #{name}"
"Hello matt"
iex(9)> if true, do: IO.puts "Peanut butter!"
Peanut butter!
:ok
iex(10)> if false, do: IO.puts "Peanut butter!"
nil
iex(11)> if nil, do: IO.puts "Peanut butter!"  
nil
iex(12)> 5 > 6 and 7 < 2
false
```

But the syntax and similarities end there.
You're thinking of programming will be challenged from here on.
